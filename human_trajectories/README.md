### Procedural Steps written by Humans

The [./trajectories](./trajectories) directory contains the human trajectories. The human trajectories are sequences of actions written by humans. The actions are separated by a comma. The human trajectories are used to generate the choice-based questions for the evaluation of the commonsense reasoning and language understanding aspect of generative models.

Each line in the file is a sequence of actions written by a human. The actions are separated by a comma.

For having a look at a sample human trajectory, run the following script:

```bash
python show_random_example.py
```
